what I want it to do:

block based interaction with code
compile/tangle to javascript?
  compile to javascript : make a js source code string and run it  (easier to serialize and webwork, but can't do macros easily)
  tangle to javascript  : make a collection of js objects that runs the code with a method  (don't need to worry about hooking up to screen)
  rust wasm             : write interpereter in rust and compile that to wasm

 * imports are hard with webworkers

multithreading

typed? : writing type systems suck.
